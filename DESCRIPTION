Description: Phylogenetic comparative methods represent models of continuous trait 
  data associated with the tips of a phylogenetic tree. Examples of such models 
  are Gaussian continuous time branching stochastic processes such as Brownian 
  motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, which regard the data at the 
  tips of the tree as an observed (final) state of a Markov process starting from 
  an initial state at the root and evolving along the branches of the tree. 
  Interpreting the parameters of such models is difficult in the case of multiple
  trait data and big trees. Building on top of the PCMBase and PCMFit R packages, 
  PCMView provides functions for visualization of such continuous trait models.
